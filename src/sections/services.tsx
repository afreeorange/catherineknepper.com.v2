        I work with traditionally and independently published authors, and offer
        a range of customized editorial and writing services that help make your
        writing project a creative and commercial success. I take particular
        care to preserve your unique vision, voice, tone, and style. Final
        approval for edits is always up to you.

      <h3>Content Editing</h3>
      <h4>Manuscript coaching + line editing + developmental editing</h4>
      <p>
        My take on Content Editing is a little unconventional, but it’s evolved
        over the years and has proven very popular with clients. This hybrid
        approach allows me to do it all: provide applause, constructive
        feedback, line-by-line editing, and suggestions and solutions on a
        granular as well as a global level.
      </p>
      <p>What you’ll receive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A real-time, informal reaction to your writing. I first engage with
          your book as a reader. I highlight what’s working well and why, pose
          queries, and identify areas that call for revision or further
          development. Emojis are used liberally. 😉
        </li>
        <li>
          Detailed, line-by-line editing. Here’s where I don my editing hat and
          provide sentence-level editing that enhances your book’s flow, syntax,
          and clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          A careful, considered response to your manuscript. More akin to the
          traditional editorial letter, this global feedback provides you with
          an assessment of the book’s overall strengths and weaknesses, along
          with specific suggestions and solutions for revision.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Book Proposal Preparation</h3>
      <h4>
        Content strategy <em>&amp;</em> marketing for nonfiction authors seeking
        traditional publication
      </h4>
      <p>
        The good news for nonfiction authors who want to publish with a trade
        publisher is that books are sold on proposal, rather than a completed
        manuscript. My Book Proposal Preparation service gives you a competitive
        proposal that’s ready to submit to literary agents, acquisitions
        editors, and publishing houses. Components include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your overview and hook</li>
        <li>Author bio</li>
        <li>Full marketing plan</li>
        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
        <li>Table of contents and chapter summaries</li>
        <li>1-3 sample chapters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <mark>
          My rates start at $9,000.{" "}
          <em>
            To date, every client whose proposal has sold has recouped the cost
            of editing with their advance.

      <h3>
        Manuscript Collaboration <em>&amp;</em> Ghostwriting (nonfiction only)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have a great idea for a book but don’t have the time, writing
        experience, or inclination to write it, let’s work together to create a
        bestseller. You can write as much or as little as you like: I’ve worked
        with authors who provided 30 pages of content per chapter to authors who
        left all the writing and research to me (and everything in between).
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve written books in as little as four months, but generally, you
        should set aside around six months for the production of a manuscript of
        60,000 – 80,000 words, and slightly longer if you’d like a book proposal
        as well. Book Proposal Preparation + Manuscript Collaboration packages
        are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        My rates are on the higher end of the professional ghostwriting scale,
        but can vary widely depending on the amount of work involved, the
        delivery deadline, and other negotiable terms such as profit-sharing and
        byline. (I do not require a byline and am happy to sign an NDA.){" "}
        <mark>
          Please contact me for details and I’ll provide you with a proposal
          outlining terms of service, deliverables, and fees.
