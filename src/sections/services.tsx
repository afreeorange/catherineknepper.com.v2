      <h3>Content Editing</h3>
      <h4>Manuscript Coaching + Line Editing + Developmental Editing</h4>
      <p>
        My approach to content editing combines big-picture developmental work
        with detailed line-level attention. What you'll receive:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reader response</strong>
          <br /> I read your manuscript cover to cover first as an engaged
          reader, not an editor, noting what's working and why. You can learn as
          much from your strengths as your weaknesses.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Line-by-line editing</strong>
          <br /> Detailed attention to flow, syntax, and clarity throughout the
          manuscript. Hands-on, sentence-level editing.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Editorial letter</strong>
          <br /> A careful assessment of the book's overall strengths and
          weaknesses, with specific suggestions and a clear revision strategy.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Follow-up meeting</strong>
          <br /> An hour-long conversation to discuss feedback and clarify your
          revision plan.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After you revise based on my first-pass edits, you'll send the
        manuscript back for a final round of editing that includes copyediting.
        The result is a polished manuscript ready for submission.
      </p>

      <p>The fee for this service is $18 per page (1 page = 250 words).</p>

      <h3>Book Proposal Preparation</h3>
      <h4>
        Content strategy <em>&amp;</em> marketing for nonfiction authors seeking
        traditional publication
      </h4>
      <p>
        My Book Proposal Preparation service gives you a competitive proposal
        that's ready to submit to literary agents, acquisitions editors, and
        publishing houses. I don't just format what you provide—I collaborate
        with you to develop each component strategically, ensuring your proposal
        demonstrates both the book's market potential and your ability to
        deliver it.
      </p>

      <p>Components include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Overview and hook</strong>
          <br /> A compelling case for why this book matters now, written to
          capture attention in the first paragraph
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Author bio</strong>
          <br /> Positioning that establishes your credibility and unique
          authority on the subject
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Marketing plan</strong>
          <br /> A comprehensive strategy covering media outreach, digital
          marketing, social media, speaking opportunities, partnerships, and
          audience-building tactics. This isn't a generic checklist—it's a
          tailored roadmap that demonstrates you understand your readers, where
          to find them, and how to build momentum before and after publication.{" "}
          <strong>
            This section alone often makes the difference between a pass and an
            offer.
          </strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Competitive analysis</strong>
          <br /> Clear differentiation from comparable titles that demonstrates
          your book's distinct value
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Annotated table of contents</strong>
          <br /> Detailed chapter summaries that show exactly what the book will
          cover and how it all flows together
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Sample chapter</strong>
          <br /> Polished writing that shows agents and editors exactly what
          they're buying and what you are capable of
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We'll work together through multiple drafts, refining the proposal until
        every element is as strong as it can be. The goal isn't just to check
        boxes—it's to build a document that makes agents want to read your full
        manuscript and editors want to acquire your book.
      </p>

      <p>
        My rates start at $12,000. To date, every client's advance has covered
        the cost of services.

      <h3>
        Manuscript Collaboration <em>&amp;</em> Ghostwriting (nonfiction only)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have a strong book concept but need a collaborator to help bring
        it to the page, I work with authors to develop manuscripts that are both
        well-crafted and market-ready. My role is flexible: some clients provide
        detailed outlines and substantial content for each chapter, while others
        prefer I handle the research and writing. We'll find the approach that
        works best for your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Timeline depends on scope, but a typical manuscript of 60,000–80,000
        words takes approximately six months. If you need both a book proposal
        and a full manuscript, we can structure the work in phases or as a
        combined package.
      </p>
      <p>
        My rates reflect the level of collaboration required, the timeline, and
        other factors such as profit-sharing arrangements. I don't require a
        byline and am happy to sign an NDA. Contact me to discuss your project,
        and I'll provide a proposal outlining deliverables, terms, and fees.
      </p>

      <h3>Consultation Hours</h3>

        letters, or publishing consultations — I work at an hourly rate of $150.
