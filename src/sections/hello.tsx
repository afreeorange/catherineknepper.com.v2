        I help writers, experts, and leaders turn complex ideas into books that
        matter.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For over twenty years, I&#8217;ve worked with people who have something vital
        to say and need a skilled partner to help them say it well. Whether
        you&#8217;re distilling decades of professional insight, uncovering the
        emotional truth of a story, or translating specialized knowledge for
        broader audiences, great books require both craft and clarity. My job is
        to help you achieve both without sacrificing either.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&#8217;ve collaborated on fifteen books, including <em>USA Today</em> and{" "}
        <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <strong>bestsellers</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Thinkers50 selections</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Next Big Idea Club picks</strong>, <em>Financial Times</em>{" "}
        <strong>best-of books</strong>, and <strong>Axiom Award winners</strong>
        . More importantly, these books have sparked real conversations, earning
        endorsements from leaders who rarely give them and the kind of critical
        attention that moves careers forward and reshapes how authors are seen
        in their fields.

        My editing clients include{" "}
        <strong>National Book Award finalists</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>
          multiple <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and Notable Books authors
        </strong>
        , <strong>PEN Award winners</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Independent Publisher Book Award recipients</strong>, and
        writers whose work has been named among the{" "}
        <strong>
          year&#8217;s best by <em>Time</em>, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, and NPR&#8217;s{" "}
          <em>Fresh Air</em>
        </strong>
        . Their books have earned{" "}
        <strong>
          starred reviews from <em>Kirkus</em>, <em>Library Journal</em>,{" "}
          <em>Booklist</em>, and <em>Publisher's Weekly</em>
        </strong>
        —and landed on reading lists from{" "}
        <strong>President Barack Obama to Malcolm Gladwell</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also develop book proposals that are as carefully crafted as the books
        they promise. Drawing on deep familiarity with how agents and editors
        read, assess, and champion projects, I help authors clarify the core
        idea, articulate market relevance, and demonstrate that the book can
        deliver.{" "}
        <strong>
          Every proposal I&#8217;ve written has sold to a major publisher.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you&#8217;re writing your first book or refining your tenth, I provide
        the editorial partnership required to move from idea to
        publication—while preserving the voice and vision that makes your work
        distinctly yours.
