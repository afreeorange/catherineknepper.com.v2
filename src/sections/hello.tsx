        I help writers, experts, and leaders turn complex ideas into books that
        matter.
      </big>
      <p>
        For over twenty years, I've worked with people who have something vital
        to say and need a skilled partner to help them say it well. Whether
        you're distilling decades of professional insight, uncovering the
        emotional truth of a personal story, or translating specialized
        knowledge for broader audiences, great books require both craft and
        clarity. My job is to help you achieve both without sacrificing either.
      </p>

        I’ve collaborated on fifteen books, including USA Today and Wall Street
        Journal bestsellers, Thinkers50 selections, Next Big Idea Club picks,
        Financial Times best-of books, and Axiom Award winners. More
        importantly, these books have sparked real conversations, earning
        endorsements from leaders who rarely give them and the kind of critical
        attention that moves careers forward and reshapes how authors are seen
        in their fields.

        My editing clients include National Book Award finalists, multiple New
        York Times bestsellers and Notable Books authors, PEN Award winners,
        multiple Independent Publisher Book Award recipients, and writers whose
        work has been named among the year’s best by Time, Entertainment Weekly,
        and NPR's Fresh Air. Their books have earned starred reviews from
        Kirkus, Library Journal, Booklist, and Publisher’s Weekly—and landed on
        reading lists from President Barack Obama to Malcolm Gladwell.

        I also develop book proposals that are as carefully crafted as the books
        they promise. A strong proposal requires more than market positioning—it
        must demonstrate that the book itself can deliver. Drawing on a deep
        familiarity with how agents and editors read, assess, and champion
        projects, I help authors build proposals that clarify the core idea,
        articulate market relevance, and position a book for serious
        consideration.{" "}
        <strong>
          Every proposal I’ve written has sold to a major publisher
        </strong>
        .{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re writing your first book or refining your tenth, I provide
        the editorial partnership required to move from idea to
        publication—while preserving the voice and vision that makes your work
        distinctly yours.{" "}
