      I help writers, experts, leaders, and visionaries bring their ideas to the
      page and their words to the marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      My clients are novelists, short story writers, memoirists, entrepreneurs,
      scientists, journalists, academics, technologists, policymakers,
      architects, business executives, health & fitness experts, and more.

      I began editing in 2003 while I was completing my MFA at the Iowa Writers'
      Workshop, became a full-time editor in 2005, and in 2009 launched my own
      editing and writing business. I've worked with hundreds of authors in
      dozens of genres, collaborated on ten books, written book proposals,
      articles, speeches, op-eds, and book marketing material, and cultivated
      relationships with many of the top literary agents in the business. The
      Writers᾿ Workshop taught me a great deal about the creative side of
      writing, but it was working as an editor and collaborator that taught me
      the business of publishing. As a writer with experience on both sides of
      the desk, I'm in a unique position to help you make your book a work of
      creative and commercial success.

      I hold degrees in English literature and philosophy & religion (B.A.),
      theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA). I've also done fiction-writing
      courses through the Harvard Extension School and Boston's Grub Street
      Writers. Along the way I've judged writing contests and vetted submissions
      for AGNI and The Iowa Review, and every now and again I get around to my
      own writing. My fiction has appeared in West Branch, The Florida Review,
      Memorious, Necessary Fiction, Meridian, and Confrontation, and The Maine
      Review.

      I'm based in Des Moines, Iowa, where I do my best to keep up with two
      teenagers and a rescue husky named Luna.
