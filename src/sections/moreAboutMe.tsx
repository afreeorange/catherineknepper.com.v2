    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <section-wrapper>
      <p>
        I'm a writer, editor, and publishing consultant with over twenty years
        of experience helping authors bring their best work to the page.

        I began editing in 2003 while completing my MFA at the Iowa Writers’
        Workshop. The Workshop taught me to read with obsessive attention to
        craft: how sentences build momentum, how structure carries meaning, how
        voice emerges from choices made at the level of syntax and rhythm. But
        it was working as an editor and collaborator that taught me the business
        of publishing—how to position a book, how agents and editors think, how
        to navigate the distance between a brilliant idea and a manuscript that
        actually sells.

        Since launching my own business in 2009, I've worked with hundreds of
        authors across dozens of genres, ghostwritten and collaborated on
        fifteen books, developed book proposals for major publishers, and
        cultivated working relationships with many of the top literary agents in
        the business. I've written speeches, op-eds, articles, and book
        marketing materials. My own fiction has appeared in West Branch, The
        Florida Review, Memorious, Necessary Fiction, Meridian, Confrontation,
        and The Maine Review.

        What I love most about this work is the partnership—helping writers find
        the structure that unlocks their argument, the scene that cracks open
        their story, the sentence that finally says what they’ve been trying to
        articulate for months. I believe great books require both vision and
        precision, and my job is to help you achieve both without sacrificing
        either.

        I hold degrees in English literature and philosophy & religion (B.A.),
        theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA). As a writer with experience on
        both sides of the publishing desk, I'm in a unique position to help you
        make your book both beautifully crafted and commercially successful.
