    <section-wrapper>
      <p>
        I'm a writer, editor, and publishing consultant with over twenty years
        of experience helping authors bring their best work to the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began editing in 2003 while completing my MFA at the Iowa Writers'
        Workshop. The Workshop taught me a great deal about the creative side of
        writing, but it was working as an editor and collaborative writer that
        taught me the business of publishing—how to position a book, how agents
        and editors think, how to navigate the distance between a brilliant idea
        and a manuscript that actually sells.

      <p>
        Since launching my own business in 2009, I've worked with hundreds of
        authors across dozens of genres, collaborated on fifteen books,
        developed book proposals for major publishers, and cultivated working
        relationships with many of the top literary agents in the business. I've
        written speeches, op-eds, articles, and book marketing materials. My own
        fiction has appeared in <em>West Branch</em>,{" "}
        <em>The Florida Review</em>, <em>Memorious</em>,{" "}
        <em>Necessary Fiction</em>, <em>Meridian</em>, <em>Confrontation</em>,
        and <em>The Maine Review</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My degrees span English literature and philosophy & religion (B.A.),
        theology (M.Div.), and fiction (MFA)—a multidisciplinary foundation that
        informs how I think about structure, argument, and narrative across
        genres. As a writer with experience on both sides of the publishing
        desk, I'm in a unique position to help you make your book both
        beautifully crafted and commercially successful.
