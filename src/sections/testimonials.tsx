          Catherine served as a fabulous, much-needed second reader on my
          (rather long and complicated) novel, <em>Cloud Cuckoo Land</em>. She
          helped me tighten language, repair chronological wrinkles, clarify
          muddled passages, and even invent some terminology. And she served as
          an essential sounding board for all sorts of revision ideas. Most
          importantly, Catherine helped me stay confident and buoyant when I was
          exhausted from the work of assembling the book. I wholeheartedly
          recommend her services.

          It's with full confidence and inspiration that I recommend Catherine
          Knepper. As a second-time author working with Harvard Business Review
          Press, I knew I needed someone who could deliver a high-quality, no
          nonsense, practical manuscript for a business audience and be able to
          do that in a way which also captured my natural style, authenticity,
          and voice as an executive coach. From the outset, I noticed
          Catherine's rigor in how she approached really understanding the
          publisher I was working with and the reader I was writing for. Her
          level of commitment only continued as we spent months working together
          to transform outlines, drafts, research, and interviews into a fully
          realized manuscript. Catherine is a gifted writer and fully brought to
          life my voice and message. In every page, you see where she has
          enhanced my thinking, considered the reader's point of view, or has
          integrated important research by selecting the right information,
          paraphrasing exactly what is needed, and footnoting all with
          precision. On top of producing an outstanding, quality end product,
          Catherine is an absolute joy to work with! She is authentic, positive,
          and encouraging all along the way, which offers an author a sense of
          important ease during a process which can bring high stress and tight
          deadlines. As I look back on my work with Catherine I'll forever be
          grateful for her being there every step of the way-not only in my
          being able to turn in my manuscript to Harvard Business Press ahead of
          schedule but also for making it a fun and wonderful experience
          overall!

          fast deadlines, but she immediately understood my objectives and
          voice, and was able to quickly identify smart solutions on exactly how
          to move it forward. She breathed new vision into my manuscript in just
          a few short weeks. Catherine puts great dedication and care into her
          work. She spends the time to do what's best for her clients, and
          handled my writing with an incredible amount of thoughtfulness. There

          Catherine Knepper is a dream of an editor. She excels at both
          diagnosing the problem and figuring out a way forward. This
          combination is extremely rare: it takes special skill to understand
          not only what a writing project is, but what it might be. What's
          especially wonderful about Catherine is that she is able to explain
          both what is wrong and what is right in a clear, supportive manner.
          I'd recommend her to any writer who wants a super-smart, talented,
          warm and professional editor who is both thorough and creative. She is
          the real deal, and seeing her work left me with just one word - wow.

          When I began writing my book I had no idea how to go about getting
          published. Then I heard about Catherine Knepper. Thanks to Catherine
          my writing project became a professional book proposal. Her critique
          of my manuscript was invaluable in adding dramatic impact and movement
          to the narrative. The proposal drew the attention of every agent to
          whom it was submitted, and in the end was accepted by a top literary
          agent who offered representation less than three hours after receiving
          the proposal.

          The idea to write a book came after 12+ years of running our own
          business. We had a genuine desire to share what we had learned with
          the next generation of entrepreneurs. We quickly learned that tackling
          this alone was not feasible, so after numerous interviews and false
          starts we were referred to Catherine Knepper. After the first
          interview we knew the search was over. Catherine has been exceptional
          to work with in every respect imaginable and has exceeded our
          expectations every step of the way. If you are looking for a
          ghostwriter look no further, Catherine is the best of the best.
